# QR Code Generator 

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jgobeille/pen/ZwEbvy](https://codepen.io/jgobeille/pen/ZwEbvy).

I created this QR code generator because the warehouse employees at my company kept mislabeling boxes and shipping them to the wrong facility. After several large mess ups consecutively, we implemented a scanning system the would check a specific number our company uses to identify parts against the customer part number. However, more than half of the parts we receive from  suppliers do not have a QR code that contains our specific part number on their labels. I made this so I, and other associates can create the QR code and send the image to our supplier to put on their boxes.
